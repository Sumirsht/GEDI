Hi my name is # Sumir # Shrestha 
This tutorial is copied from https://github.com/ornldaac/gedi_tutorials/blob/main/
I do not own anything from this.
I made this code to make my study research easier. The study region of my location is in the Terai. 
This tutorial shows how to search and download Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) L4A Footprint Level Aboveground Biomass Density (AGBD) dataset. GEDI L4A dataset is available for the period starting 2019-04-17 and covers latitudes of 52 North to 52 South. GEDI L4A data files are natively in HDF5 format, and each file represents one International Space Station (ISS) orbit. 

It use NASA's Earthdata Common Metadata Repository (CMR) Application Programming Interface (API) to search for GEDI L4A files or granules for time and area of interest. CMR catalogs metadata records of NASA Earth Science data and make them available for easy programmatic access. Area of interest can be defined using a bounding box (Option 1) or using polygons (Option 2).

This tutorial shows how to download the granules of your area of interest.
